### 1.5 Overview
The remainder of this document describes the overall system context, detailed functional requirements, interface specifications, non-functional requirements, and supporting tools that will be employed to deliver PyCIPSim.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
PyCIPSim will operate as a standalone simulation toolkit that can be integrated into existing Python-based testing frameworks. The simulator will model both client and server behaviors for CIP messaging by leveraging the `pycomm3` library to enforce protocol compliance and message formatting.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The system will provide functionality to configure simulated devices, issue CIP service requests, process responses, log transaction data, and inject configurable fault scenarios for robustness testing. Support for automated execution will enable users to script complex test scenarios.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
Primary users will include automation engineers, software developers, and QA testers who require a lightweight environment to validate CIP integrations. Users are expected to be familiar with Python scripting and basic Ethernet/IP concepts.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
The simulator will run on Python 3.10 or newer in POSIX-compliant environments (Linux, macOS) and Windows. Networking capabilities will rely on the underlying operating system's TCP/IP stack for loopback and remote communications.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
The system must rely on `pycomm3` for protocol handling, restricting low-level CIP message construction to interfaces supported by the library. All dependencies must be installable via `pip` without requiring proprietary components. The simulator will adhere to open-source licensing requirements compatible with the project.

### 2.6 User Documentation
The project will deliver README documentation, usage tutorials, and API references describing configuration options, scenario authoring, and integration steps with CI pipelines.

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
It is assumed that users have access to Python development environments and can install `pycomm3` and supporting packages via PyPI. The simulator depends on `pycomm3` to maintain compliance with Ethernet/IP specifications and to simplify client-server interactions.
